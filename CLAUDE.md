# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a new homeapp project that has been initialized as a Git repository. The project structure and technology stack have not yet been established.

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project, the development environment and build tools need to be set up based on the chosen technology stack.

Common technology stacks for home applications include:
- **Web Application**: React/Vue/Angular with Node.js backend
- **Mobile Application**: React Native, Flutter, or native iOS/Android
- **Desktop Application**: Electron, Tauri, or native frameworks
- **IoT/Smart Home**: Python, Node.js, or embedded C/C++

## Project Initialization Guidelines

When setting up this project, consider:

1. **Technology Stack Selection**: Choose appropriate frameworks and tools based on the target platform(s)
2. **Project Structure**: Establish a clear directory structure (src/, tests/, docs/, etc.)
3. **Package Management**: Set up package.json (Node.js), requirements.txt (Python), or equivalent
4. **Build System**: Configure build tools, linting, and testing frameworks
5. **Development Scripts**: Create common commands for build, test, lint, and development server

## Common Commands

*Commands will be added here once the project structure is established*

## Architecture Notes

*Architecture documentation will be added here as the project develops*

## Development Notes

- This project is in initial setup phase
- Technology stack and architecture decisions should be documented here as they are made
- Update this file with build commands, testing procedures, and architectural decisions as the project evolves
